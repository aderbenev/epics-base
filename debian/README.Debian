== Init script for iocLogServer

When the 'ioclogserver' package is installed, the logger
automatically runs and begins writing /var/log/epics/epics.log

== epics-win32

The Mingw32 cross-compiler is used to build for the win32-x86-mingw
target.  Currently no DLLs are produced.  Only .lib and
statically linked executables.

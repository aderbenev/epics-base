<h1 style="text-align: center">EPICS Base R3.15.3: Known Problems</h1>

<p>Any patch files linked below should be applied at the root of the
base-3.15.3 tree. Download them, then use the GNU Patch program as
follows:</p>

<blockquote><pre>% <b>cd <i>/path/to/</i>base-3.15.3</b>
% <b>patch -p0 &lt; <i>/path/to/</i>file.patch</b></pre></blockquote>

<p>The following significant problems have been reported with this
version of EPICS Base:</p>

<ul>

  <li>See LaunchPad bug
    <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/epics-base/+bug/1466129">#1466129</a>:
    The feature that allows an IOC to bind to a single network interface is not
    working correctly. The bug mentioned above contains a patch that has been
    tested on Linux-64, a complete fix is expected for 3.15.4. Note that Windows
    systems are not affected by this bug.</li>

  <li>Parallel builds ("make -j") on native Windows are not working properly.
    Builds tend to hang (saturating one core); interrupting and running make
    again usually finishes the build. Limiting the number of parallel jobs using
    something like "make -j8" also helps prevent this problem. Sequential builds
    always work and are recommended for automated build environments.</li>

  <li>64-bit Windows builds of the CAS library may not work with some compilers.
    The code in <tt>src/legacy/gdd</tt> is currently incompatible with the LLP64
    model that Windows uses for its 64-bit ABI.</li>

</ul>
